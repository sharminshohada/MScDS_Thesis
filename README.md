The HandMovement project uses DeepLabCut for analyzing hand movements. Due to the use of Git LFS (Large File Storage), some files cannot be directly viewed on GitHub. To access these files:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/HandMovement.git
Download the LFS files: git lfs pull
The remaining Python files can be viewed directly on GitHub.
